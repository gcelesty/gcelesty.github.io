            <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
            <p>Apple</p>
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/">https://www.apple.com/</a>
            <p>White space in a website correlates to a minimalistic design. By integrating white space into your website shows the user can only focus and see one item at a time. It also helps with no distractions. It can give a sense of balance to your website if it is used properly. Benefits of white space is increased comprehension, highlight and isolate important elements, and creates a tidier and more user friendly design. With Apple's website you can see the massive amounts of white space to represent elegance and class while having the user only focus on one item at a time.</p>

            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
            <p>Spotify</p>
            <a href="https://open.spotify.com/">https://open.spotify.com/</a>
            <p>Hick's law states that the time to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices present. The more choices that are available to you the longer it will take for you to come to a decision. Hick's law helps users simplify their decision making process while not completely removing it. This also helps to direct users to functions of top priority, better conversion rates, and ensure that the user does not get confused on a page. With the Spotify application and web browser there are multiples features such as liking a song, adding songs to a playlist, and thumbs up or thumbs down a song. With the friendly design of the website it allows users to spend more of their time playing media and less time deciding what to listen to.</p>

            <h3>Fitt's Law</h3>
            <p>Gmail</p>
            <a href="https://www.google.com/gmail/">https://www.google.com/gmail/</a>
            <p>Fitt's law is a predictive model of human behavior. The law states that the futher away a target is and the smaller the size of the target, the longer it takes for a user to aquire it. In other words its the amount of time required for a person to move a pointer to a target area. A good example of this is when you are using Gmail to write an email to someone and the delete/discard button is on the opposite side of the send buttn to avoid accidentally choosing an unfavorable option.</p>
